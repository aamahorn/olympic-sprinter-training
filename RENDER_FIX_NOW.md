# Fix Your Render Deployment (2 Minutes)

Your app URL https://olympic-sprinter-training.onrender.com is showing "Not Found" because Render can't install the Python packages.

## Quick Fix:

### Download from Replit:
1. `requirements_fixed.txt` (Python dependencies)
2. `render.yaml` (deployment config)

### Upload to GitHub:
1. Go to your repository
2. Upload `requirements_fixed.txt` as `requirements.txt` (rename it)
3. Replace `render.yaml` with the new version

### Result:
Render automatically rebuilds and deploys your app. Your permanent URL will work in 3-5 minutes.

The fix ensures Render can properly install Streamlit and all dependencies needed for your Olympic sprinter training app.
